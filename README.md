# GapMinder-Hans-Rosling

Recreated Features:
Bar chart representing the number of countries per region.
Bar chart representing the number of countries with each government type.
The selection of a specific country from the provided drop-down list, gives a static visualization depicting the trace of motion of the bubble representing that country.
When a viewer uses this control, the remaining controls to jump to the visualization of a specific year and the Play/Pause/Stop buttons would be disabled.
The viewer must select the default value “All Countries” from the drop-down list explicitly, to re-enable all the disabled controls. NOTE:
Both bar charts would be displayed to the right of the Gapminder World visualization.
